Description:
This class represents a playerâ€™s wallet and game-related stats.
It is marked as [System.Serializable] so it can be easily saved, 
loaded, or sent over the network as JSON or other serializable formats.

Key Features:
1. Player Stats: Stores player's name, level, bike level, experience points (XP), and battle wins.
2. In-Game Currency: Holds balances for SOL and TRON tokens.
3. Bike Customization: Tracks bike color and bike upgrade level.
4. Wallet Integration: Stores the player's connected wallet address.
5. Constructor Initialization: Automatically populates fields from PlayerScores and ConnectToWallet classes.

Notes:
- This class assumes PlayerScores and ConnectToWallet are already populated.
- Can be extended to include other in-game stats or blockchain-related info.
